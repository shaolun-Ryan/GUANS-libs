*****
for trial:
`import 'guans-style'`
or:
`import 'dist/guans-style.js'`
or:
`import '.css'`

Note that
---
Font-awesome is no longer one of the dependencies of guans-style cuz
its far eazier to load it from <script> tag than bui it with webpack. 
It needs many loaders and its meaningless.

Tutorial
---
import `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./fa/css/font-awesome.min.css">` into root html.
this file is in `dist` folder.
